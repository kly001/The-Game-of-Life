My Process:

These notes are to journal my work on this Build Week Project. Keeping a detailed record of my thoughts,
    coding process and difficulties will help my future self overcome "Imposter Syndrome" and
    show proof of my progress.  This is something that I have not had much success in the past so
    it will be a top priority.
    

1.  The first decision I had to make was a no brainer for me:  What language will I use? Why?

    I am using React, an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The homepage, 
    (https://reactjs.org/) declares that React is :
        * Declarative - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views 
        for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just 
        the right components when your data changes.  Declarative views make your code more 
        predictable and easier to debug.

        * Component_Based - Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose 
        them to make complex UIs.  Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of 
        templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

        * Learn Once, Write Anywhere - We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology 
        stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.  React can
        also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
    
    My reasons are simple.  It is the first language that I learned.  I'm more familiar and comfortable with
        Javascript.  Python is the language I am presently learning, but I don't feel comfortable enough to
        use it for a project.



2.  Using 'create-react-app', I setup the boilerplate for my code and tweeked it a bit to my liking. A 
    components directory was created to hold the following files:
        * Navigation Bar - Links to the pages of the app.  Can be altered as the application grows. 
        * Home - landing page; will contain information about the game and the rules for playing.
        * Game - contain the code that makes the game works.
        * Grid - contains the code than defines the game grid.
        * Box - contains the code for each individual cell(box).
        * Buttons - contains the code for the buttons that are used to play the game.


3.  Dependencies:
    * Bootstrap - the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and 
            mobile-first websites.
    * React Bootstrap - React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each 
            component has been built from scratch as a true React component, 
            without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.  React-Bootstrap has evolved 
            and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.
            Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive 
            to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem.  By relying entirely 
            on the Bootstrap stylesheet, React-Bootstrap just works with the thousands 
            of Bootstrap themes you already love
    * React-Router-DOM - offers a way to write your code so that it will show certain components 
            of your app only if the route matches what you define.

4.  Game.js - main component; contains the entire game page
    * need to import Buttons and Grid for display
    * need to display a counter for the 'generations'(stored as a state variable in Games.js)
    * need to define state variables(constructor)
    * setup initial values for generation, rows, columns and speed.
    * gridFill: This creates a 2-dimensional array, 30 by 50,  with each element set to false;
        an array of rows filled with a map of an array of columns where each
        element(box) is initially set to false to show that it is 'off' or dead (nested arrays)
    * pass props (gridFill, row, cols) into render; (NOTE ==> selectBox still needs to be setup at this point)
        
5.  Grid.js - setting up the grid
    * rowsArr: returns an array of all the rows
    * define width of the grid (this.props.cols)
    * define rows array; initially empty
    * iterate over array
    * boxClass - check if the specified box is ON (true) or OFF (false)
    
6.  Box.js - setting up individual boxes for the grid
    * id and boxClass are rendered
    * onClick function, to change the color of a box when it is clicked,
        which will called the selectBox function
    *  pass in props for the rows and cols

7.  Game.js
    * selectBox method - determines whether a box is on or off and changes it to the opposite value
    * gridFillclone function (helper function to be used again)-  array is copied 
        by first stringifying it and then parsing it to make a deep clone of all 
        the arrays inside the array
    * populate method - to turn on random boxes from the start
    * componentDidMount() - life-cycle hook; runs populate method
    * playButton() and pauseButton() - start and stop the game play
